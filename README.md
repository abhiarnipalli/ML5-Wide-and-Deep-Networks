# Wide and Deep Networks for Automobile Loan Default Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the implementation and evaluation of wide and deep network architectures using the Automobile Loan Default dataset. The primary objective is to compare the performance of wide and deep networks with standard multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to determine which architecture provides better predictive accuracy for the task of loan default prediction.

- Artificial Intelligence (AI)

## Introduction
Wide and deep networks combine the strengths of memorization (wide part) and generalization (deep part) for predictive tasks. In this project, we apply these architectures to predict automobile loan defaults using a dataset containing various financial and demographic features. The comparison between wide and deep networks and standard MLPs provides insights into the effectiveness of these architectures for complex classification tasks.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Automobile Loan Default dataset, which includes features such as loan amount, interest rate, borrower income, credit score, and other relevant attributes. The dataset is used to train and evaluate different models to predict the likelihood of a loan default.

## Results
The performance comparison between wide and deep networks and standard MLPs is documented in the `results/performance_comparison.csv` file. The accuracy plots for the models are available in the `results/model_accuracy_plots.png` file. The results indicate that wide and deep networks outperform standard MLPs in terms of predictive accuracy and robustness.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of wide and deep networks for the task of automobile loan default prediction. By comparing these architectures with standard MLPs, we find that wide and deep networks offer superior performance, leveraging both memorization and generalization capabilities. The insights gained from this project can guide the development of more effective predictive models for financial risk assessment.
